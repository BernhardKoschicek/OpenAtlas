# Code of Conduct

## Collegiality
Since OpenAtlas is developed by a small team, it is especially important that 
everyone feels comfortable and can develop within it. Therefore, we put great
emphasis on friendly and respectful interactions with each other. Please show
compassion and empathy in general but especially for other team members as well
as cooperation partners. Suggestions for improvement and well-meant criticism,
if constructive, is welcome and appreciated and should be gratefully accepted.
Please be kind to each other!


## Open Source
OpenAtlas was designed as a pure open source project and therefore uses 
exclusively open source technologies. It is and always will be free of charge
and open source to guarantee continued usage. Furthermore, within the project,
great importance is attached to transparency and public accessibility (e.g. via
https://openatlas.eu/ and https://redmine.openatlas.eu/). In order to guarantee
the quality of the application now and in the future, emphasis is placed on 
testing code during development. Please also note the 
[FAIR](https://www.go-fair.org/fair-principles/) principles. 

## Cooperation
As OpenAtlas puts great emphasis on open source and open data strategies, please
note that a cooperation is only possible if you are able to make your data
entered into the system open access as well.

As part of the scientific community and through our institutional affiliation
with the Austrian Center for Digital Humanities and Cultural Heritage 
([ACDH-CH](https://www.oeaw.ac.at/acdh/)), it is important for us to follow the
rules of good scientific practice.
