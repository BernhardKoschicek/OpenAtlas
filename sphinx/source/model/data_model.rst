data model
==========

.. toctree::

While the model uses `CIDOC CRM <https://www.cidoc-crm.org/>`_ as
ontology, it can be used without prior knowledge of data models, ontologies,
etc. The software automatically maps information to the model. As the
definitions of the CIDOC Conceptual Refernece Model was imported into the
system, its `classes <https://demo.openatlas.eu/overview/model/cidoc_class_index>`_
and `properties <https://demo.openatlas.eu/overview/model/property>`_ can be
browsed directly in OpenAtlas (see also :doc:`here</cidoc_crm>`).
Furthermore, it is possible to verify link-conformity between entities via the
`link-checker <https://demo.openatlas.eu/overview/model>`_ (for more
information click here :doc:`here</link_checker>`).

During the development much emphasis was put on the fact that users do not have
to concern themselves with the model or its ontology. Nevertheless, it is
possible to display the CIDOC classes used in the user interface and thus gain
insight into how the data is mapped.

Pressing the **Model** button on the start page leads to a
graphical presentation of the model (see below), a
:doc:`link checking tool</link_checker>` and links to the classes and
properties.

Furthermore, it is possible to active **Show CIDOC classes** in the user
interface. This will displays the CIDOC class of an entity in the detail view
of a data base entry.
To do so click the gear symbol and choose :doc:`profile</tools/profile>`. Go
to **Display**, press the **Edit** button and choose **Show CIDOC classes**.
