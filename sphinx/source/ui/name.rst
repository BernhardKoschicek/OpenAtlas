The name field is one of the few required fields which are marked with an
asterisk.
It's important to choose a fitting name for every entry as it is used to
find data in tables and within the global :doc:`/tools/search`.

Duplicate names are allowed but if they don't differ in e.g. the standard
type, it will become difficult to differentiate them from each other.
