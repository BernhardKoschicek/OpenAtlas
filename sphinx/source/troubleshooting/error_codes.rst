403 - Forbidden
---------------

You are trying to access a page that you don't have permissions to access.
This can happen if you try to edit an entity as user with **read only**
status. The user interface shouldn't provide you with links to sites
that are restricted for your user, so maybe you used an obsolete link or
bookmark. If this happens regularly, please report the issue.

404 - File not found
--------------------

The site you requested cannot be found. Maybe you used an obsolete link or
bookmark.

418 - Iâ€™m a teapot
------------------

This message is displayed if you tried to access an entity with an ID that
doesn't exist (anymore). Maybe you used an obsolete link or bookmark.
