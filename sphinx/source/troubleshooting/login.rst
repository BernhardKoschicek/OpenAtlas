Login

.. toctree::

Depending on the issue, please try the following solutions to log in.

Wrong Password
--------------

You can activate the **show password** checkbox to see the entered password
and make sure that the problem isn't keyboard related, e.g. if capslock is
turned on.

You can request a new password by clicking the
**Forgot your password?** link. It is directly located underneath the login
button. This is only possible if an email address was provided in the
profile settings previously.


No user with this name found
----------------------------

Either you misspelled the username or the user doesn't exist (anymore).

If there is a **Forgot your password?** link below the login button you can
request a new password. The information will be sent to the provided email.
A new username is provided together with the password.

This user is not activated
--------------------------

Your user was deactivated. If you think this was done by mistake, please
contact your project manager.

Too many login attempts
-----------------------

For security reasons (e.g. automatic attacks) the login gets locked after a
few failed attempts. The number of failed attempts and minutes to wait until
you can try again depend on project specific settings. If you can't try
again after a few minutes, please contact your project manager.
