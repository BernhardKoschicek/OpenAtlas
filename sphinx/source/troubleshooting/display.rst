Display Errors
==============

.. toctree::

This is a general topic in case there are display errors such as out of place
elements, missing or not working items. Many reasons can cause errors
and a malfunction most likely was not caused by you but here are
some suggestions what you can try on your side to fix them.

Browser Version
---------------

Make sure your browser is up to date. We try to support all major browsers but
due to OpenAtlas using advanced features a current version may be required.

Refresh your Browser
--------------------

Sometimes browser cache (remember) older content. A refresh should solve this
problem. For example, in Firefox this can be done by pressing the
**F5** key.

JavaScript
----------

JavaScript is required for advanced features to work. In case you haven't
activated JavaScript in our browser settings, a warning message will be
displayed.

If the problem persists
-----------------------

If none of the above solutions work, please report the bug to us. There is a
**Feedback** link at the start page after you logged in. It would be very
helpful if you provide which browser/version you are using and a screenshot
showing the problem. You can also go to
`redmine <https://redmine.openatlas.eu/>`_ directly and report the issue there.
