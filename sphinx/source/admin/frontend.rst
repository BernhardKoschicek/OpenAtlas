Frontend
========

.. toctree::

Many projects like to have a presentation site (frontend) to make the project
results accessible to a wider audience. In case there is already a running
version of a presentation site following values can be configured to create
links to it in the backend:

* **Website URL** - address of the presentation site, e.g.
  https://frontend-demo.openatlas.eu/. It will be displayed at the backend
  overview.
* **Resolver URL** - in case entity details can be viewed using the id at
  the end of an URL, a resolver URL can be specified. E.g. with the
  resolver URL **https://frontend-demo.openatlas.eu/entity/** a link for the
  presentation site view of an entity would be shown in the backend and would
  look like this: https://frontend-demo.openatlas.eu/entity/5560
