API
===

.. toctree::

The API links are only visible for user with activated **advanced layout** in their
:doc:`/tools/profile` but any logged in user has access to the API. Currently there is only one
setting for the API but there will be more while we extend it in the next versions.

* **Public** (default=off). If you turn it on the API can be accessed even without logging in. This might be useful if you want the data open anyway to allow other systems to use it.
