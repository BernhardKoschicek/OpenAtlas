When logged in you can access your **profile** at the right top of the site. There you can edit
personal information and adapt the user interface to your preferences.

Change password
---------------
When clicking on **Change password** you have to enter your current password and a new one (twice).

General
-------
* **Full name** - optional, provide your full name to make it easier for other users to identify you.
* **Email** - providing an email address is important in case you have to reset your password.
* **Show email** - uncheck to hide your email for other users (except admins and managers).
* **Newsletter** - check to receive newsletters including an unsubscribe link.

Display
-------
* **Language** - select your language for the user interface.
* **Table rows** - amount of rows that are shown on one table page.
* **Show aliases in tables** - show aliases of actors and places in tables and make them searchable.
* **Layout** - in advanced you see more information about entities, e.g. the CIDOC class, creation/modification date and author and a link to the API.
* **Default map zoom** - define the lowest zoom level to include all features on a :doc:`/tools/map` view.
* **Max map zoom** - adjust how far you can zoom into a :doc:`/tools/map`.

Modules
-------
With modules you can decide which features you want the user interface to include.

* **GeoNames** - to use the GeoNames feature at :doc:`/menu/place` insert or update.
* **Map Overlay** - to see overlays on the :doc:`/tools/map` or insert new ones (editor or above).
* **Notes** - an additional tool for your workflow, e.g. to add a personal reminder to an entity.

If notes are activated you can add notes with **+ Note** when viewing an entity. Notes will be
displayed at the entity view and also all notes will be displayed at the :doc:`/menu/overview`.

Be aware that:

* Your notes are only visible to you (for public notes use the description field)
* There is only one note per entity possible
* Notes will get deleted if the entity is deleted by you or anybody else
