Tables are used to show multiple entries at a glance. To navigate quickly multiple tools are available:

* **Sorting** - click on the header to sort the entries, click a second time for invert sorting
* **Search** - type into the search field on top right to filter entries containing the term
* **Paging** - if there are multiple pages you can navigate with the buttons below

The amount of entries per page can be configured in your :doc:`/tools/profile`
