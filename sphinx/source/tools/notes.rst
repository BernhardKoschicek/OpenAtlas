.. toctree::*

**Notes** are an additional tool for your workflow and can be used to add a
personal reminder to an entity, etc.. They are not part of the :doc:`data
model</model/index>` and won't be shown on presentation sites or be archived.

* Notes can be added by using the notes tab when viewing an entity
* Notes will be displayed at the entity view and at the :doc:`/overview`
* Notes set to private (default) are only visible to you, public notes can be
  seen by everybody with access to the OpenAtlas instance
* Notes will be deleted if the entity is deleted by you or anybody else
* Admins or manager can set notes of other users to private (e.g. in case
  they are inactive)
