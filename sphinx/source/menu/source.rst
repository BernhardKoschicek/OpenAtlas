several entities. On the source index page is an overview of already entered sources with their
type and description.

* Click **+ Source** to enter a new source.
* Click on the **name** of an entry in the list to access the detail view.
* To edit an object, click on the **Edit** button in the detail view.

Form fields:

* :doc:`../form/name`
* :doc:`../form/type`
* :doc:`Information carrier <../menu/object>`
* **Content** - a source content usually contains a summary or the whole text of the source

Can be linked to:

* :doc:`event`, :doc:`actor` and :doc:`place` it references
* :doc:`reference` where it is documented in, e.g. in various editions of charters or secondary sources
* a **translation** respectively to the text in the original language (e.g. Latin), can be a comment too
