They are organized hierarchically into trees and specific for each project.
There are different kind of types: A distinction is made between different
groups of types:

* Standard types

* Value types

Different user groups have different permissions regarding the creation and
modification of types. Further information can be found in the manual entry
regarding :doc:`/entity/type`. Please note that possibility to add and edit
types depends on the user group, see :doc:`/admin/user`.

An overview of the types already created can be accessed by clicking Types menu

To create a new custom type or value type tree press the +Type button on the
bottom of the page. Please fill out the form:

* Choose a descriptive **name** for the new type
* Decide if the type is single or **multiple choice** (only available for custom
  types)

  :doc:`/entity/artifact` or :doc:`/entity/place`.

You can edit the type’s name, chosen classes and description. Please note that
changing multiple to single choice is not possible.

Add a type to an existing type tree
-----------------------------------

Types can be added dynamically in forms (with at least editor permission) with
basic information like name, description and super type.

A more detailed way to create a new type in an already existing standard,
custom, or value type tree, is to find that type tree in the overview and
click on it.

  description will be displayed when you mouse-over the information button next
  to the type’s name in the data entry form

By pressing insert you can create a new type tree.
