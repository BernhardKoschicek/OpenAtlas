How to report an issue
======================

.. toctree::

This short tutorial describes the best way to report an issue.
OpenAtlas uses `Redmine <https://www.redmine.org/>`_ as an issue
tracker. It is a flexible project management web application that is open
source and released under the terms of the
`GNU General Public License v2 <https://www.gnu.org/licenses/old-licenses/gpl-2.0.html>`_.

In addition to being used as
`OpenAtlas issue tracker <https://redmine.openatlas.eu/projects/uni>`_, the
application is used to publish
`public meeting minutes <https://redmine.openatlas.eu/>`_, for
`technical documentation <https://redmine.openatlas.eu/projects/uni/wiki>`_ and
to plan and document the project's own
`roadmap <https://redmine.openatlas.eu/projects/uni/roadmap>`_.

Where to report - Redmine
-------------------------

While using OpenAtlas, problems (bugs) can occur from time to time. This is
due to the active and dynamic further development of the database system. If
problems occur when using the application, it would be great if these
get reported. This is the only way we as a team can ensure that bugs
caused by the database itself can be rectified quickly and that data input
works smoothly again.

The easiest way to report such a problem is via
`OpenAtlas Redmine <https://redmine.openatlas.eu/projects/uni>`_.

How to report
-------------
To report an issue, an account must first be created. This is of course completely free and all you need is a valid email address and a password.
Activation is not automatic, but is carried out manually by the OpenAtlas team. This may take some time. Therefore, it might be best to create an account before it is needed to report bugs
