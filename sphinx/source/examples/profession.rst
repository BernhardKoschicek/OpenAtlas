Profession
==========

.. toctree::

The following steps describe how to enter the profession of a person
In OpenAtlas a profession exists in connection to a group e.g. a group of
people working as bakers or professors at a university.
To add a profession to a person, follow the steps below:

* Create a person, see :doc:`/entity/actor`, for example "Max Mustermann"
* Create a group, see :doc:`/entity/actor`, such as "Historians"
* In the actor form, press the **Member of** tab
* Click the **Link** button
* In the form use **Type** to choose the function of the person within the group
* Choose the specific group or groups in the **Actor** field
* Add date and/or description if desired

You can get the same result by using the **Member** tab in the group view
and link a person there.

Keep in mind that it is possible to edit the available functions or add new
ones in :doc:`/entity/type` via **Standard types** and **Actor function**.
