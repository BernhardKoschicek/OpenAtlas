Profession
==========

.. toctree::

The following steps describe how to enter a profession connected to a person.
In OpenAtlas a profession exists in connection to a group (e.g. an institute, country, etc.).
To add a profession to a person, follow the steps below:

* Create a person, see :doc:`/entity/actor`
* Create a group, see :doc:`/entity/actor`
* Press the **Member of** tab in the actor
* Click the **Link** button
* In the form use **Type** to choose the function of the person within the group
* Choose the specific group or groups in the **Actor** field
* Add date and/or description if desired

You can get the same result by using the **Member** tab in the group view and link a person there.

Keep in mind that it is possible to edit the available functions or add new ones in :doc:`/entity/type`
via **Standard types** and **Actor function**.
