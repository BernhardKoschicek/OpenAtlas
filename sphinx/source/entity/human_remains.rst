Human remains
=============

.. toctree::

Human remains are used to record anthropological data based on single human bones. They are subunits of a :doc:`stratigraphic_unit`
which itself is a subunit of :doc:`feature`. Please note that information on the biological sex, gender,
and age of an individual can be entered in the stratigraphic unit entry mask. For an archaeological workflow example see
:doc:`/examples/archaeological data`.

Super and subunits
------------------
In the OpenAtlas database Human remains are subunits of a :doc:`stratigraphic_unit`. A Stratigraphic unit can consist of one or
more Human remains (e.g. femur, humerus and first molar of the same individual, etc.) as well as finds (see :doc:`artifact`).
Human remains do not have subunits.
