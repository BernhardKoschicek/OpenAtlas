"Human remains" is used to record anthropological data based on each human
bone. They are subunits of a :doc:`stratigraphic_unit` which itself is a
subunit of :doc:`feature`. Please note that information on the biological sex,
gender, and age of an individual can be entered in the stratigraphic unit
entry mask. For an archaeological workflow example see
:doc:`/examples/archaeological_data`.

Super and subunits
------------------
In the OpenAtlas database Human remains can be subunits of a
:doc:`stratigraphic_unit` (e.g. a human femur (human remains) of a skeleton
(stratigraphic unit) in a grave (feature)). A
Stratigraphic unit can consist of one or more Human remains (femur,
humerus and first molar of the same individual etc.) as well as finds (see
:doc:`artifact`).
