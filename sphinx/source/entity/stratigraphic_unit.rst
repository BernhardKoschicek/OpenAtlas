Stratigraphic unit
==================

.. toctree::

Stratigraphic units are used to record archaeological data. They are subunits of a :doc:`feature` which itself is a
subunit of a :doc:`place`. For an archaeological workflow example see :doc:`/examples/archaeological data`.

You can edit all types after clicking the **Types** tab.


Can be linked via tabs to
-------------------------
* :doc:`source` - when it is referenced there
* :doc:`event` - as an event location
* :doc:`reference`
* Find (see :doc:`artifact`)
* :doc:`human_remains`
* :doc:`file`
* **Note**


Super and subunits
------------------
In the OpenAtlas database a Stratigraphic unit is a subunit of a :doc:`feature`. A Feature can consist of one or
more Stratigraphic units (e.g. grave as feature can contain one or more burials, a backfilling, etc.). Stratigraphic
units themselves are structured in the same way and can be connected to Finds (see: :doc:`artifact`) and
:doc:`human_remains` as their subunits.
