Entity
======

Most information that historians work with comes from historical documents.
Usually, the first step is to digitize the **sources** to facilitate working
with them.
Often the next step is to identify bits of information like **actors**,
**events**, and **places** and map them so that you can ask questions like:
*Where was this person in the course of his life?* or *Who participated in
an event?*

For archaeologists a first step is to create a new :doc:`/entity/place` and
link subunits such as a :doc:`/entity/feature` and a
:doc:`/entity/stratigraphic_unit`. For a detailed workflow example see
:doc:`/examples/archaeological_data`.

The :doc:`/ui/menu` structure reflects that workflow.
