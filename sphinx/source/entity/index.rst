Most information that historians work with comes from historical documents. Usually, the first step
is to digitize the **sources** so that they are easier to work with. Often the next step is to
identify bits of information like **persons**, **events** and **places** and map them so that you
can ask questions like: *Where was this person in the course of his life?* or
*Who participated at an event?*

For archaeologist the first step of workflow is to create a new :doc:`/entity/place` and link subunits
e.g. :doc:`/entity/feature` and :doc:`/entity/stratigraphic_unit` to it. For a detailed workflow example see
:doc:`/examples/archaeological_data`.

The :doc:`/ui/menu` structure reflects that workflow.
