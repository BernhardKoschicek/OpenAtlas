Type

.. toctree::

Types are used to add information or group entities. They are hierarchical and
can be accessed and edited via the **Types** :doc:`/ui/menu` item. With this
feature the model and user interface can be adapted for specific research
interests.

* The root type description is shown in forms as a mouse over text at
  the **i** icon
* **Untyped entities** can be checked at the type overview
* **Multiple linked entities** can be checked at the type overview, useful if
  switching to single
* A more detailed description on how to enter new types can be found
  :doc:`here</examples/types>`

Standard types
--------------
Standard types are already present in the default installation with a few
examples.

* Cannot be deleted or renamed (but subtypes of them can)
* Are single select only
* In forms they appear with a **Type** label
* Are displayed in entity tables

Custom types
------------
Custom types can be created, deleted and renamed. The default installation
comes with one example custom type **Sex** which is used for actor.

* Can be set to allow single or multiple choices
* Can be used for multiple classes, e.g. a hierarchy "case study" for places,
  actors and events

If you want to change an existing **multiple type to single** but the
multiple checkbox is greyed out and not selectable it means that at least one
entity already used multiple. You can check these entries at the type overview
at **multiple linked entities**.

Value types
-----------
Value types can be created, deleted and renamed. The default installation comes
with an example value type **Dimensions** with the sub types **Height** and
**Weight** which are used in the form for artifacts.

* Can be used for multiple classes
* Values can be entered as decimals in forms

Form fields
-----------
* :doc:`/form/name`
* :doc:`/form/description`
* :doc:`reference_system`
* :doc:`/form/date`
* A super (type) if it is a sub type of another type
