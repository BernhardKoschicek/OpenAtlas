Super and subunits
------------------
In the OpenAtlas database a feature is a subunit of a :doc:`place`. A :doc:`place` can consist of one or more subunits
called Features (e.g. buildings, graves, pits, ditches, ramparts etc.). Features themselves are structured in the same
way as Places and can consist of one or more subunits that are labelled as :doc:`stratigraphic_unit`.
