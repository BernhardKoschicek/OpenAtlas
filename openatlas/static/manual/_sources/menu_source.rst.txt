    Content - a source content usually contains a summary or the whole text of the source

A source can be linked to translations respectively to the text in the original language
(e.g. Latin). The source can also be linked to a reference e.g. a physical object
(parchment manuscript) of the original charter that carries the information described in the source.
The source can also be documented in other documents like for example various editions of charters
or also secondary source.
