Types are used to add information or group entities. They are hierarchical and can be accessed and
edited via the **Types** menu item. With this feature the model and user interface (forms) can be
adapted for specific research interests.

* Type names can't include round brackets
* Type descriptions are shown in forms as a mouser over text at the **i** icon

**Standard types**

Standard types are already present in the default installation with a few examples.

* Cannot be deleted or renamed (but subtypes of them can)
* Are single select only
* In forms they appear with a **Type** label
* Are displayed in entity tables

**Custom types**

Custom types can be created, deleted and renamed, e.g. you can add a new typ "hair color" for
persons. The default installation comes with one example custom type **Sex** which is used in actor
forms.

* Can be set to allow single or multiple choices (once multiple can't be revert to single later)
* Can be used for multiple forms,  e.g. a hierarchy "importance" for places, actors and groups

**Value types**

Value types can be created, deleted and renamed. The default installation comes with an example
value type **Dimensions** with the subtypes **Height** and **Weight** which are used in the form
for finds.

* Can be used for multiple forms
* Values can be entered as decimals in forms
