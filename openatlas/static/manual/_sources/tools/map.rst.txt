* *GeoNames ID* The "GeoNames":http://www.geonames.org/ ID of the place. Can either be manually entered or automatically imported from a selected Map Search Result.
_Note_: this field is only available, when the GeoNames Module is activated in the [[Profile]] section. The checkbox "exact match" can be used if there is a high degree of confidence that the concepts can be used interchangeably. By default it is a close match, which means that the concepts are sufficiently similar that they can be used interchangeably in some information retrieval applications. Please refer to "SKOS":https://www.w3.org/TR/skos-reference/ for further information.

h2. Map Overlay

If you have the module map overlay activated in the [[Profile]], overlays for places which they were added will be visible on the map by default and can be toggled at map layer button at the right top.

To insert new overlays (group editor or above) go to the view of a specific place. After adding an image file in the file tab you can click *add* in the overlay column to enter coordinates for the left upper and bottom right corner to position the image on the map.
